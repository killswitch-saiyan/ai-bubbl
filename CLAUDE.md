# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Python project named "ai-bubbl" that appears to be in its initial setup phase. The repository currently contains only a Python virtual environment setup.

## Environment Setup

- **Python Version**: 3.12.9
- **Virtual Environment**: Located in `venv/` directory
- **Environment Activation**: 
  - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
  - Unix/macOS: `source venv/bin/activate`

## Development Commands

Since this project is in its initial state with only a virtual environment, no specific build, test, or lint commands are currently configured. When working with this project:

1. Always activate the virtual environment first
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` when a requirements file is added
3. Use standard Python development practices for package management
4. Remember you are teaching and guiding me here technically to achieve my vision. Please give solution to teach and guide me rather than accepting with my views always
5. You are too agreeable by default. I want you objective. I want a partner. Not a sycophant. Play the devil's advocate

## Project Structure

The project is currently minimal:
- `venv/`: Python virtual environment containing pip and standard library packages
- No source code, configuration files, or documentation present yet

## Notes for Development

- This appears to be a fresh Python project setup
- No package.json, requirements.txt, or other configuration files are present
- No existing code structure to follow - this is a greenfield project
- Standard Python project conventions should be applied when adding code
